    <br><h3>I. Top countries by active cases</h3>

    <p><br>

      The key indicator of the coronavirus outbreak is the number of daily active cases. This is the total number of
      confirmed cases, minus the reported number of deaths, minus the total recovered people in a given day. In other
      words it is the current number of people  with the coronavirus disease. The chart below shows the top 10 countries
      by active cases through time.

      You can also check the 'static' chart below for the active cases by country where you can select the number of
      elements to display and see the evolution of the pandemics through time.

    <br><h3>II. Visualizing the waves</h3>

    <p><br>

      As we did for the confirmed cases below is a graphic where the wave behaviour of the pandemics can be better
      visualized for a given country. The darker areas with more concentrated dark strips means a peak in time for
      the rate of infections in the country
