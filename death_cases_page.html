    <br><h3>I. Absolut Numbers</h3>

    <p><br>

      The worst aspect of the coronavirus lies on its mortality. This is represented by the total number of deaths
      due to covid-19. In the chart below it's possible to visualize this impact on every region, where the arcs are
      proportional to the total number of deaths of each country. Once again this is an interactive chart, so click
      in a specific region for zooming or just hover over anywhere to check the numbers.

      Once again we use the heat map to visualize the daily deaths through time for a country. Just select the
      desired country in the dropdown menu to visualize it.

    <!-- DEATH RATE CHART -->

      <h3>II. Death rate</h3><br>

      <p>

      Some broadcast medias try to illustrate the devastation caused by the coronavirus by showing the
      deaths/100k numbers. Despite being a valid metric, I don't like to use it in this case and the reason is
      quite simple: A person can't die from covid if he/she is not down with the covid. By applying this
      methodology they end up putting healthy and unhealthy people in the same baskett and this is a huge
      mistake that leads people to underestimate its mortality.

    </p>

    <p>

      The graphic below shows the mortality rate of the covid-19 by each country as a deaths/confirmed ratio. The
      graphic is interactive so hover over the dots, select a specific label for zooming and explore the infos.
      The numbers of Iemen, with an ongoing civil war are devastating. More than a quarter of the infected dies.
      The top 5 is composed by the poorest countries of the eastern mediterranean and latin america


    </p>

    <p>

      Moreover the death rate is the right parameter to check for health system collapse. There's no oficial
      base number adopted to indicate when the country's health system has collapsed but I would guess, based
      on my readings in the media that any country with death rate higher than 1.7% have at some point and at
      some extension faced some collapse in their health system.
