      Hi, there! This page is supposed to be just a cool way to visualize some aspects of the coronavirus outbreak, so you
      won't find here any deep analysis, modelling or advanced machine learning estimation of the near future. I will
      acknowledge here most of the tools that made possible to build this page and also provide some links if you're interested
      in a more deep analysis of the pandemics.

    </p>

    <p style="text-align: justify">

      All graphics presented here were build with <a href="https://flourish.studio/">Flourish Studio</a>. It's a very interesting
      web based visualization app with the option of creating storytellers, which is a cool way to present your data. As an example
      you can check my own storytelling for this project <a href="https://public.flourish.studio/story/516016/">here</a>.

    </p>

    <p style="text-align: justify">

      All data is made available by <a href="https://systems.jhu.edu/research/public-health/ncov/">Johns Hopkins University</a>. I
      use python 3 to collect all the available data from their github repository and build the dataset that provides the numbers
      presented here. If you're interested in check my work just visit my <a href="https://github.com/psychopresley/COVID-19">
      github repository</a> for this project. Aside from this page I also have a <a href="https://public.tableau.com/profile/psychopresley#!/vizhome/Covid19_15951776377290/Dashboard">
      dashboard</a> build with <a href="https://public.tableau.com/en-us/s/">Tableau public</a>. There you will find a deeper
      analysis of the pandemics with much more visualization options. It's worth to take a look. Also I made available a dataset
      with the compiled numbers that can be accessed <a href="https://data.world/psychopresley/covid19tracking/workspace">here</a>.
      It has some saved queries that can be run and provide you with cool informations about the pandemics. Feel free to check it!

    </p>

      Finally, I only have a free acount in the Flourish app. This does not allow me to update all data automatically so I have
      to do it manually, which means that I will not update the data everyday. With a paid membership account I'd have the
      possibility of update the graphics using a google sheet API. No problem. So I'll update all graphics twice a week, on
      sundays and thursdays in the morning. All number presented here were updated on january 21th, 2021, so I see you again
      next sunday!
