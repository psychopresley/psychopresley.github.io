      Hi, there! This page is supposed to be just a cool way to visualize some aspects of the coronavirus outbreak, so you
      won't find here any deep analysis, modelling or advanced machine learning estimation of the near future. I will
      acknowledge here most of the tools that made possible to build this page and also provide some links if you're interested
      in a more deep analysis of the pandemics.

    </p>

    <p>

      All graphics on this page were build with <a href="https://flourish.studio/">Flourish Studio</a> and last updated in
      January 18th, 2021. It's a very interesting web based visualization app with the option of creating storytellers, which
      is a cool way to present your data. As an example you can check my own storytelling for this project
      <a href="https://public.flourish.studio/story/516016/">here</a>. So, if you are interested in dive deep in the numbers
      here it is a few pages I recommend you to visit:

      <ul style="text-align: justify">
        <li>Original data source: <a href="https://systems.jhu.edu/research/public-health/ncov/">Johns Hopkins University</a></li>
        <li>JHU visual dashboard. That's the most confident page to get real time data: <a href=" https://www.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6">JHU CSSE</a></li>
        <li>If you're interested in checking my work just visit my project repository at github: <a href="https://github.com/psychopresley/COVID-19"> project repository</a></li>
        <li>Also, my own visual dashboard, build with Tableau public. There you will find a deeper analysis of the pandemics
          with much more visualization options. It's worth to take a look: <a href="https://public.tableau.com/profile/psychopresley#!/vizhome/Covid19_15951776377290/Dashboard">The Covid-19 Dashboard</a></li>
        <li>I also made available a dataset with the compiled numbers. It has some saved queries that can be run and provide you with
          cool information about the pandemics. Feel free to explore it! <a href="https://data.world/psychopresley/covid19tracking/workspace">Tracking the covid-19</a></li>

      </ul>

    </p>

    <p>

      I use python 3 to collect all the available data from their github repository and build the dataset that provides the numbers
      presented here. I only have a free acount in the Flourish app, which does not allow me to integrate the data with google drive
      automatically so I have to do it manually, which means that I will not update this page everyday. No problem. I'll update it
      twice a week, on sundays and thursdays in the morning.
