      One way to visualize the impact of the Sars-Cov-2 outbreak in the world is to divide it
      into geopolitical regions. It is natural to assume that the numbers are higher in the regions
      with higher economic activity and trade level with China, where the first cases of infection
      were reported. All the data in this presentation is based on the numbers up to January 1st, 2021.

        Imagine that the total number of people infected by the Sars-cov-2 virus since the beginning of the
        outbreak is scaled to a group of 1000 people gathered together in a room. This would be the distribution
        of cases according to the region of origin of the members in that group. Hover the mouse on the map to
        visualize the numbers by region.
